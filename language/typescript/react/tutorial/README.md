# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

```sh
> npx create-react-app tutorial
```

## Available Scripts

- `yarn start`
  - Run in dev mode. Check http://localhost:3000.
  - The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
- `yarn test`
  - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `yarn build`
  - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
  - The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
- `yarn eject`
  - **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
  - Remove the single build dependency from your project.
  - Copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies\
    so you have full control over them.
