## Concept

- Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) 
- REST Application에 대한 제약사항.
- Client는 server가 hypermedia를 통해 제공하는 정보를 통해 상호작용함.
- it's the concept that when sending information over a RESTful API the document received should contain everything the client needs in order to parse and use the data i.e they don't have to contact any other endpoint not explicitly mentioned within the Document.
